While the final result isn't exactly what I was looking for, I am proud of what is basically my first real game.

This version keeps the original spirit of the design document, get to the top of the building. At that's still true with this version.

I decided to stick to strictly keyboard controls instead of supporting controller too. I wanted to keep things simple.

I played around with running up wall, but It didn't feel right. I also played around with a double jump, but that didn't feel right either. I ended up with a wall jumping and sliding down that I think feels good.

I got sound effects that feel nice and I made cool 8 bit art that's limited to the NES color palette. I'm happy with the results.

Like I thought, getting the feeling right was challenging.

Other than the wall running mechanic, I think it pretty much keeps the original vision of the design document.
